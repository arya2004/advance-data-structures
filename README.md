## Introduction

Understanding data structures is crucial for writing efficient and scalable programs. This repository focuses on implementing advanced data structures in C, providing both the code and explanations to help you grasp their concepts and usage.

## Data Structures Implemented

Here are some of the data structures implemented in this repository:

- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- Graph (Adjacency List)

Each data structure comes with detailed explanations of its implementation, time complexity analysis, and examples of how to use it.

## How to Use

To use any of the data structures in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arya2004/advance-data-structures.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired data structure's directory:
   ```
   cd advance-data-structures/src
   ```

3. Compile the source files using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```
   gcc -o main main.c data_structure.c
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./main
   ```

Refer to the specific data structure's documentation in the repository for more detailed instructions on usage and customization.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new data structure implementations to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
